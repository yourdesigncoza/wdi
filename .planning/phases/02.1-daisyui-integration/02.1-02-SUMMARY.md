# Phase 02.1 Plan 02: Component Migration to DaisyUI Summary

ConsentModal migrated to modal-open CSS pattern (non-dismissible for POPIA), PrivacyPolicy and InfoOfficerContact migrated to card/fieldset/alert DaisyUI classes. Zero hard-coded Tailwind colors across all 3 files.

## Task Commits

| Task | Name | Commit | Key Changes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Migrate ConsentModal to DaisyUI | e2c646f | modal-open, btn, alert-error, link-primary, loading spinner |
| 2 | Migrate PrivacyPolicy and InfoOfficerContact to DaisyUI | e34e387 | card sections, fieldset forms, alert success/error, loading spinners |

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Migrate ConsentModal to DaisyUI
- Modal wrapper: `fixed inset-0 z-50 ... bg-black/50` replaced with `modal modal-open` (CSS-only, no `<dialog>`, ESC cannot dismiss)
- Modal box: `bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl` replaced with `modal-box`
- Header icon: `bg-blue-100` / `text-blue-600` replaced with `bg-primary/20` / `text-primary`
- Title/body: removed hard-coded `text-gray-900` / `text-gray-700` (inherits from theme)
- Links: `text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline underline-offset-2` replaced with `link link-primary`
- Separator: `text-gray-300` replaced with `text-base-content/30`
- Error alert: hand-rolled red div replaced with `alert alert-error alert-soft`
- Accept button: all utility classes replaced with `btn btn-primary flex-1` + loading spinner
- Leave Site button: all utility classes replaced with `btn btn-outline flex-1`
- Actions wrapper: added `modal-action mt-0` for proper alignment

### Task 2: Migrate PrivacyPolicy and InfoOfficerContact to DaisyUI

**Shared patterns (both files):**
- Page background: `bg-gray-50` replaced with `bg-base-200`
- Loading state: text replaced with `loading loading-spinner loading-lg text-primary`
- Error card: hand-rolled div replaced with `card bg-base-100 shadow-sm` + `card-body`
- Error text: `text-red-600` replaced with `text-error`
- Back link: hand-rolled color classes replaced with `link link-primary`
- Go Back buttons: hand-rolled classes replaced with `btn btn-primary`
- Title: `text-gray-900` replaced with `text-base-content`
- Subtitle: `text-gray-500` replaced with `text-base-content/50`
- Section cards: `bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6` replaced with `card bg-base-100 shadow-sm` + `card-body`

**PrivacyPolicy-specific:**
- Policy sections in `.map()`: each section wrapped in `card` with `card-body` and `card-title`
- Body text: `text-gray-700` replaced with `text-base-content/70`

**InfoOfficerContact-specific:**
- Definition list labels: `text-gray-500` replaced with `text-base-content/50`
- Definition list values: `text-gray-900` replaced with `text-base-content`
- Description text: `text-gray-600` replaced with `text-base-content/60`
- Contact links: `text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800` replaced with `link link-primary`
- Success alert: hand-rolled green div replaced with `alert alert-success alert-soft`
- Error alert: hand-rolled red div replaced with `alert alert-error alert-soft`
- Request Type field: label+select replaced with DaisyUI `fieldset` + `fieldset-legend` + `select`
- Details field: label+textarea replaced with DaisyUI `fieldset` + `fieldset-legend` + `textarea`
- Submit button: hand-rolled classes replaced with `btn btn-primary w-full` + loading spinner

## Decisions Made

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 02.1 (DaisyUI Integration) is now COMPLETE. All frontend components are migrated:
- App.tsx (02.1-01): navbar, btn, card, loading spinner
- ConsentModal (02.1-02): modal-open, btn, alert, link, loading
- PrivacyPolicy (02.1-02): card, btn, link, loading
- InfoOfficerContact (02.1-02): card, btn, alert, fieldset, select, textarea, link, loading

No hard-coded Tailwind color classes remain in any component. Ready for Phase 3 (conversation UI).

## Self-Check: PASSED
