# Phase 02.1 Plan 01: DaisyUI Installation and Theme System Summary

DaisyUI v5.5.18 installed with @plugin directive, corporate/business themes with auto dark mode, ThemeToggle component with localStorage persistence, App.tsx fully migrated to semantic DaisyUI classes.

## Task Commits

| Task | Name | Commit | Key Changes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Install DaisyUI and configure theme system | a293d19 | daisyui devDep, @plugin config, data-theme on html |
| 2 | Create ThemeToggle and migrate App.tsx | 3837772 | ThemeToggle component, LandingPage + MainContent migration |

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Install DaisyUI and configure theme system
- Installed daisyui@5.5.18 as devDependency
- Added `@plugin "daisyui"` with `corporate --default, business --prefersdark` to index.css
- Added `data-theme="corporate"` to `<html>` element in index.html
- Verified build passes cleanly

### Task 2: Create ThemeToggle and migrate App.tsx to DaisyUI
- Created `ThemeToggle` component using DaisyUI swap-rotate + theme-controller pattern
  - Initializes from localStorage (`wdi-theme` key), defaults to corporate
  - useEffect syncs data-theme attribute and localStorage on every change
  - Sun/moon SVG icons for visual toggle indicator
- Migrated `LandingPage`:
  - Header replaced with DaisyUI `navbar` with `navbar-start`/`navbar-end`
  - ThemeToggle added to navbar-end for unauthenticated users
  - Sign In button: hand-rolled utilities replaced with `btn btn-primary`
  - Sign Up button: hand-rolled utilities replaced with `btn btn-outline`
  - All hard-coded colors replaced with semantic names (bg-base-200, text-base-content)
- Migrated `MainContent`:
  - Loading state: text replaced with `loading loading-spinner loading-lg text-primary`
  - Header replaced with DaisyUI `navbar` with start/center/end sections
  - ThemeToggle + UserButton in navbar-end
  - Content card: hand-rolled div replaced with `card bg-base-100 shadow-sm` + `card-body`
  - All hard-coded colors replaced with semantic names

## Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D-0201-01 | corporate + business theme pair | Corporate is explicitly for business contexts; business provides matching dark theme for professional legal platform |

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run build` passes | PASS |
| No hard-coded colors in App.tsx | PASS (0 matches for gray-/blue-/red-/green-/bg-white) |
| DaisyUI in package.json | PASS (daisyui@^5.5.18) |
| @plugin in index.css | PASS |
| data-theme in index.html | PASS |
| ThemeToggle named export | PASS |

## Next Phase Readiness

Plan 02.1-02 (component migration) can proceed immediately. All DaisyUI infrastructure is in place:
- @plugin configured with themes
- ThemeToggle available for import
- Semantic color patterns established in App.tsx as reference
- No blockers identified

## Self-Check: PASSED
